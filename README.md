# S2T Rover (Scout32 → Titan)

This repository contains a **distributed research rover project** focused on
learning, architecture correctness, and long-term experimentation.

The system is designed around a **Brain / Spine** split:
- A Linux-class SBC (“Brain”) for orchestration and tooling
- One or more MCUs (“Spine”) for real-time control and safety

This is a **learning and research platform**, not a product.

## Important Notes

- This project is **not safety-certified**
- Autonomy is **explicitly gated and experimental**
- Clean architecture and human understanding are prioritized over features
